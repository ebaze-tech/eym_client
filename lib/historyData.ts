As we prepare to crown a new Oba, it becomes our duty to retell the story of Eruwa with accuracy, dignity, and pride so that generations to come may know the truth and walk with their heads held high.",

    title: "The Beginning",
    content: "Let us begin where it all started, in the thick forests that lay between Iseyin and the route we now call the Iseyin-Lagos express road. It was in those times, long before the convenience of modern roads and urban growth, that a young royal woman from Oyo wandered through the vast wilderness. Her name was Princess Oyinlola, a daughter of the Alaafin of Oyo. She had strayed deep into the forest, her path uncertain, her heart determined, until she noticed something unusual in the distance. There was smoke rising gently, steady, a clear sign that life was nearby. She was drawn to it.",

    title: "The Union",
    content: "That smoke led her uphill, where she encountered Obaseeku, a lone hunter and a noble man who had left the palace of Oyo to seek a new path. He was not just a man of the bush; he was a man of vision, a man of destiny. When he met Oyinlola, he saw more than a stranger. He saw partnership. He persuaded her to stop her wandering and make the hilltop her home. In him, she found not just safety, but companionship. She agreed to stay. And so began a union that would give birth to a legacy.",

    title: "Akalako: The Protected Child",
    content: "Their first child was named Akalako, meaning “the vultures have rejected this.” The name was inspired by a powerful moment. In those days, vultures were known to roam freely and fearlessly through the dense forests, scavenging at will. But something about the birth of Akalako sent a spiritual message. Even the vultures refused to touch what belonged to this sacred union. The child was blessed, protected, and destined for remembrance.",

    title: "Olaribikusi: A Destiny Revealed",
    content: "Their second child would carry an even deeper destiny. When the boy was born, Princess Oyinlola looked around her and saw the beauty and peace of the hill upon which she now lived. She said with gratitude and conviction, “This is where I will stay forever.” From that moment, the child was named called Olaribikusi a name that carries the meaning of finding one’s true home, a name born out of the joy of settlement and peace. That child would go on to change the course of history for our dear town Eruwa.",

    title: "The Journey to Oyo",
    content: "Obaseeku, mindful of tradition and the importance of royal protocol, decided one day to journey back to Oyo. He needed to present himself before the Alaafin, the father of the woman he had taken as wife. It was a visit of respect, accountability, and tradition. He could not continue to live as though Oyo did not matter. So he went, taking with him the young Olaribikusi, who was still a little child at the time.",

  {
    title: "The Royal Transfer",
    content: "At the palace of the Alaafin, something remarkable happened. While Obaseeku spoke with the king, young Olaribikusi began to play around the crown of the Alaafin. At first, it was ignored as the innocent curiosity of a child. But then the boy began to cry uncontrollably, persistently as though something within him longed for more than play. He would not be quiet, and nothing seemed to comfort him.\n\nMoved by the scene and guided by ancestral intuition, the Alaafin handed the crown to the child and said, “Take it.” That moment was more than symbolic. It was a royal transfer. The ancient crown of Oyo, once resting on the head of kings, now passed into the hands of a child born of the forest, a prince by blood, a future king by destiny. And that was how Olaribikusi brought the crown down to Eruwa, the hill settlement founded by his father.",

It was Olaribikusi, the son of Obaseeku and Oyinlola, who was formally crowned and recognized. That moment was not just a turning point in the history of Eruwa, it was the birth of a dynasty. The royal line of the Eleruwa began with him.",

    title: "A Legacy Clarified",
    content: "Let it be stated clearly and without confusion: Obaseeku founded the land, but Olaribikusi was the first to wear the crown. The tradition of rulership, the lineage of the Eleruwa, began not with a hunter, but with the child who returned from Oyo wearing a crown given to him by the Alaafin himself. That is why Eruwa stands today as both ancient and royal. We were not conquered into kingship. We were born into it. We did not receive our crown by force, but by birthright and divine timing.",

Our town has never been captured, never enslaved, never taken into bondage, not even during the bloody expeditions of the Dahomey warriors, who ravaged parts of Yorubaland in search of captives. Eruwa stood firm, protected by its hills, its warriors, and its unity. We were and remain a free people.",

In the early days, women selling roasted yam would shout, “Èrú wà níbí o,” meaning “there is roasted yam here.” Travelers and passersby would stop, rest, eat, and find comfort. Over time, that phrase evolved into the name of the town Eruwa. Simple, yet profound. Born from hospitality, and now the name of a land with royal pride.",

    title: "The Lineage of Kings",
    content: "The throne of Eruwa, wrapped in honour and ancestral grace, has passed through a distinguished line of royal custodians who each left an indelible mark on the town’s history. It began with Olaribikusi, the first crowned Eleruwa, a son of Obaseeku and Oyinlola, who carried the sacred crown from Oyo to the hills of Eruwa. After him came Olasubu Akangbe Osin, whose reign was marked by deep wisdom and peace. Gbajumola the first, fondly called Afasan, followed with visionary leadership. He was succeeded by Sabi Ayinla Edu, whose time brought unity, and then Olurin Iyanda Agan, known for his strength and counsel. Omoni Alade Efon came next, a ruler who guided the town through changing times. The mantle then passed to Sangotola the first, followed by Bankole Akangbe Agan, and Ajao Oti, each bearing the weight of tradition with dignity. Bameke Alabi Agan and Fasina Akindele ruled with honor before Adegboeye, who reigned from 1947 to 1959, bringing stability and structure.\n\nThe legacy continued with Solomon Olanrewaju Olaribikusi the second, and followed by popular Oba Bolanle Olaniyan Gbajumola the second. Most recently, Samuel Adebayo Adegbola Akindele the first, who later became Ajojo Olurin the first, brought a modern face to the ancient throne. Through each era, the Eleruwa kings have stood as symbols of tradition, resilience and cultural pride, ensuring that the spirit of Eruwa remains ever vibrant and respected.",

From the original quarters to modern areas like New Eruwa, Okolo, Temidire, and Lagaye, we are a people on the move growing but never forgetting, changing but never abandoning our roots.\n\nAs we prepare to place the crown upon the head of a new Eleruwa, let us remember that we do not begin today. We are continuing a story that started with a wandering princess, a lonely hunter, a curious child, and a divine crown. That is our origin. That is our pride.",

Obaseeku laid the foundation, but the crown sat first upon his son. History is not just memory -it is the root of our honour.\n\nLong live Eruwa.\nLong live the Eleruwa.\nLong live the crown that never fell.",
