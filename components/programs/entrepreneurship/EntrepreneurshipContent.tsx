            Rooted in Royalty, Rising Through Unity

            <span className="font-bold text-gray-900">Eruwa</span> is not merely a location on the map of Oyo State—it is a living testament to resilience, royalty, and communal strength. Our story begins with Princess Oyinlola and the visionary hunter Obaseeku, whose union on the sacred hills of <span className="font-bold text-gray-900">Ibarapa East</span> laid the foundation for a dynasty that remains unbroken to this day. It was their son, Olaribikusi, who carried the crown from Oyo and became the first Eleruwa, embedding kingship not through conquest, but through divine heritage and collective destiny.

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
            From these royal roots grew a town that has never been conquered, never enslaved—a community protected by its hills, its unity, and its unwavering spirit. The very name “Eruwa” emerged from the call of market women—“Èrú wà níbí o”—a symbol of hospitality, sustenance, and gathering. This spirit of community care and shared responsibility continues to define us.

            Community Development: Our Shared Responsibility
          </h3>
          
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
            Today, the legacy of our ancestors lives on through the hands of our youth, the vision of our leaders, and the collective will of our people. Community development in Eruwa is not imposed from outside—it is grown from within, nurtured by the same unity that has protected us for generations.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
            Recently, the New Eruwa Youth Forum demonstrated this enduring spirit by collectively purchasing cement and sand to fill portholes along community roads. Led by Babatunde Olugbade and joined by Comrade Tijani Kazeem of the Eruwa-Ojoko Youth-Development Mission, this initiative reflects more than just road repair—it represents a modern expression of our ancestral values: self-reliance, communal responsibility, and proactive leadership.

            Our Development Philosophy
          </h3>
          
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
            In Eruwa, development is guided by three enduring principles:
          </p>
          
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 text-gray-600 text-lg">
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold text-gray-900">Community-Led Action:</span> Just as our ancestors built their homes on the hills of Ilewu, Adoko, and Okele, today&apos;s initiatives are driven by local voices and hands. From youth forums to elder councils, development springs from collective decision-making.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold text-gray-900">Sustainable Progress:</span> We build not just for today, but for generations to come. Each project—whether infrastructure, education, healthcare, or economic empowerment—is designed with longevity in mind, ensuring that progress endures.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold text-gray-900">Cultural Continuity:</span> Our development honors our heritage. The same unity that allowed Eruwa to remain unconquered now fuels our collaborative projects. The same hospitality that gave our town its name now welcomes partnerships and growth.
            </li>
          </ol>

            A Call to Collective Action
          </h3>
          
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
            The story of <span className="font-bold text-gray-900">Eruwa</span> is still being written. Each filled pothole, each new school block, each health initiative adds another line to our narrative of progress. We invite every quarter, every forum, and every individual to join in this work—not just as initiators, but as maintainers of progress.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
            Together, we honor the legacy of Olaribikusi&apos;s crown, the wisdom of our past rulers, and the enduring spirit of a people determined to thrive. Let us continue to build an Eruwa where history is preserved, communities are empowered, and development is shared by all.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg font-bold">
            From the hills of our ancestors to the roads of today, we build forward—together.
