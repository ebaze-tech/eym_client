            <span className="font-bold text-gray-900">Eruwa</span> is not merely a location on the map of Oyo State—it is a living testament to resilience, royalty, and communal strength. Our story begins with Princess Oyinlola and the visionary hunter Obaseeku, whose union on the sacred hills of <span className="font-bold text-gray-900">Ibarapa East</span> laid the foundation for a dynasty that remains unbroken to this day. It was their son, Olaribikusi, who carried the crown from Oyo and became the first Eleruwa, embedding kingship not through conquest, but through divine heritage and collective destiny.

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
            From these royal roots grew a town that has never been conquered, never enslaved—a community protected by its hills, its unity, and its unwavering spirit. The very name “Eruwa” emerged from the call of market women—“Èrú wà níbí o”—a symbol of hospitality, sustenance, and gathering. This spirit of community care and shared responsibility continues to define us.

            Community Development: Our Shared Responsibility

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
            Today, the legacy of our ancestors lives on through the hands of our youth, the vision of our leaders, and the collective will of our people. Community development in Eruwa is not imposed from outside—it is grown from within, nurtured by the same unity that has protected us for generations.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
            Recently, the New Eruwa Youth Forum demonstrated this enduring spirit by collectively purchasing cement and sand to fill portholes along community roads. Led by Babatunde Olugbade and joined by Comrade Tijani Kazeem of the Eruwa-Ojoko Youth-Development Mission, this initiative reflects more than just road repair—it represents a modern expression of our ancestral values: self-reliance, communal responsibility, and proactive leadership.
